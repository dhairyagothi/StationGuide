## Using Station Guide

This project utilizes React for the frontend and Express for the backend, providing a robust foundation for your web application development.

### Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need the following:

- Node.js (version 14 or later): https://nodejs.org/en/
- npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

**Understanding Cloning:**

Cloning creates a local copy of the project on your computer, allowing you to work on it independently. This local copy is a mirror image of the original repository on GitHub or similar platforms.

Use Git to clone this repository into your local development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhairyagothi/StationGuide.git
```

**After Cloning**
You will see this interface in your system :

### 2. Running the Development Server

#### Frontend:

- Open a terminal or command prompt window.
- Navigate to the frontend directory:

```Bash
cd frontend
```

- Start the frontend development server :

```Bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically launch the React application on http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port) in your browser.

#### Backend:

- Open another terminal or command prompt window (separate from the frontend window).
- Navigate to the backend directory:

```Bash
cd backend
```

Start the backend development server (typically using nodemon server.js or a similar command):

```Bash
npm run start
```
